## Description

Disconnect Privacy Icons shows you a set of icons for every site you visit and search result you see. At a glance, you'll understand the most important terms from a website’s privacy policy and other information about how your data is collected, used and handled.

These icons evolved from a Mozilla-led working group that included some of the most prominent privacy organizations, like the Electronic Frontier Foundation, Center for Democracy and Technology, and W3C. Privacy Icons is powered by data from the TRUSTe Privacy Policy Database, which includes in-depth analysis of the privacy policies of thousands of websites around the world.
